<p class="lede pad"><span class="dropcap salmon">A</span>re you on the fence? Have I piqued your curiosity? Are you just scrolling because the colors are pretty? In all three cases, there's likely a question below, and an answer below it, that will spark your fancy.</p>
<section class="faq">
	<h3>How is this different from Patreon?</h3>
	<p>First, to be perfectly clear: this whole operation is <a href="https://patreon.com/killermann" title="Sam Killermann on Patreon">powered <em>by</em> Patreon</a>.</p>
	<p>But the way I'm doing this is different from other Patreon-ers on two fronts:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>My patrons don't get more of what I create (more comics, more articles, more podcasts, more whatever), or exclusive access to my creations.</li>
		<li>My patrons aren't funding my work in just one dimenison (e.g., writing for a particular site, creating a particular podcast).</li>
	</ol>
	<p>The relationship between me and my "patrons" is more similar to the historical usage of the word than the way most people are using it on Patreon.</p>
	<p>I'm not viewing patrons as "super consumers." I'm not creating for my patrons. We, together, are creating for the world. <a href="https://politicworm.com/oxford/oxfords-life-in-a-nutshell-shakespeare/shakespeares-patrons/">Like Shakespeare and his patrons</a>.</p>
	<p>Only I don't expect you to be an Earl, and I surely hope you don't expect me to be the Bard.</p>
	<h3>How much does it cost?</h3>
	<p>You choose my salary. My ask is that base it on what feels right for <em>you</em>, based on your financial ability, sense of gratitude or fairness, or whatever else moves you.</p>
	<p>There's no minimum (beyond the $1 threshold, which Patreon sets) no maximum, and you're welcome to adjust what you pay every month.</p>
	<h3>Is the color scheme of this site based on a pair of socks and a scarf you own?</h3>
	<p>Yeppppppppp.</p>

	<h3>Do we get special benefits for being your employer?</h3>
	<p>You mean beyond the benefit of being able to -- collectively, with one another and with me -- take credit for all the good we're doing? Yes! Here are three concrete things:</p>
	<ol><li>**Employer discounts on any physical thing I make**: you can get anything for the base cost, or whatever beyond that you want to pay. Just ask.</li>
	<li>**Participate in Quarterly Reviews**: every three months you'll get the chance to review my performance, and I'll do a Q&A with my bosses.</li>
	<li>**Insider perspective**: get a full view behind the scenes of everything that goes into the things I make, publish, and do.</li>
	</ol>
	<h3>Is this legal?</h3>
	<p>I assume so. Granted, technically speaking, in a legal sense, you aren't my "boss" &mdash; so you're not on the hook for things like healthcare (don't have it) or worker's comp (hope I don't need it).</p>
	<p>Also, since we are speaking technically, my lawyer is <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BkgEtu2no8W/" title="Chewie">a puppy</a>. So I'll hand this one <a href="https://www.patreon.com/legal" title="Patreon Legl">over to Patreon</a>.</p>
